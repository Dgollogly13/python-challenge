# Python Challenge

The goal of this challenge was to analyze two sets of data and present the results in a clear and comprehensible fashion. The datatsets included polling results from four candidates in a local election and month to month profit or loss results for a financial institution. 

## Getting Started 

### Analysis and Coding 

For the financial insitution, I utilized Python to loop through the data and 

```
output = (
    f"\nFinancial Analysis\n"
    f"----------------------------\n"
   
    f"Total Months: {month_count}\n"
    f"Total: {total_net_value}\n"
    f"Average  Change: {net_change}\n"
    f"Greatest Increase in Profits: {greatest_gain}\n"
    f"Greatest Decrease in Profits: {greatest_loss}\n"
   )
```
